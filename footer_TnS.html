                <blockquote>
                    Arbitration is a method of resolving a Claim without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, The Outset Group, and/or any involved third party relating to your account, Your Use (defined above), your relationship with The Outset Group, or these
                    Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use of our products, your attempted use of our products, and any act or omission by The Outset Group or any third party related to your use or attempted
                    use of our products. You, The Outset Group, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. The Outset Group agrees to binding arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to binding arbitration should you have any Claims against The
                    Outset Group. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration and is governed by and
                    enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.
                </blockquote> 
                <b>Exceptions to Binding Arbitration.</b>
                <blockquote>
                    As an exception to binding arbitration, you and The Outset Group both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis. The Outset Group will not demand
                    arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court. Binding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent
                    infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.
                </blockquote>

                <b>Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator.</b>
                <blockquote>
                    You agree that any Claims shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to final and binding arbitration before a single arbitrator who is a retired judge or an experienced attorney with experience in the subject(s) of the Claim. The arbitrator shall be chosen from
                    JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.
                    The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall
                    have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or The Outset Group.
                </blockquote>
                <b>Arbitration Fees.</b>
                <blockquote>The Outset Group shall pay for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for an arbitration initiated by either party. The parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</blockquote>
                <b>Arbitration Award.</b>
                <blockquote>
                    The arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law. The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law. The arbitrator may
                    award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it. Although The Outset Group may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, The Outset Group agrees that it will not seek such an award,
                    unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator’s ability to award remedies provided by applicable law. Any award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to
                    appeal under the FAA.
                </blockquote>
                <b>Enforceability.</b>
                <blockquote>
                    This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with The Outset Group, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or
                    representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration
                    provision shall remain in full force and effect.
                </blockquote>
                <b>Miscellaneous.</b>
                <blockquote>
                    Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims. This provision is the entire arbitration
                    agreement between you and The Outset Group and shall not be modified except in writing by The Outset Group.
                </blockquote>

                    [1] Information about Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Safe Harbor:
                    This “Copyright Policy“ section has been included because the Website may include user content. We recommend you take advantage of the DMCA safe harbor.
                    The DMCA provides certain “safe harbor” provisions that insulate online service providers (OSP) from liability for copyright infringement for infringing activities of its end users. In addition to meeting the requirements for each safe harbor exemption, an OSP must
                    comply with the following to qualify for the safe harbor protection under the DMCA: (a) Give notice to its users of its policies regarding copyright infringement and the consequences of repeated infringing activity. (b) Follow proper notice and takedown procedures.
                    Once a copyright owner provides proper notice of allegedly infringing material to the OSP, or the OSP discovers such material itself, the OSP must remove, or disable access to, the material; provide notice thereafter to the individual responsible for such material;
                    provide such individual with an opportunity to provide proper “counter-notice;” and comply with applicable procedures thereafter. (c) Designate an agent to receive notices of infringement from copyright owners (and provide the Copyright Office with contact
                    information for such agent and make such information available on its website). Note that the designated agent may be a designated title such as “Copyright Agent,” so that different persons at the company may perform such role over time and to obviate the need
                    for more frequent updates of the designation with the Copyright Office.
                    See: <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/">http://www.copyright.gov/onlinesp/</a> for the applicable forms and more information.
